  At first, I had no idea what I was looking at when I stumbled upon the video collection site. But after further investigation, I found myself scrolling my mouse over to the “sculpture” and realizing I could click on all of it. Each line on the site is a video of a specific art piece for the viewer to learn about. This stunned me because I just thought it was there to look pretty. At times, I didn’t even know what I was clicking on because it was so small. nonetheless, It was still pretty cool. My only critique would be that I wish it was much bigger because, once again, I didn’t know what I was clicking on and I would sometimes find myself clicking on the same thing. Overall, the page is very interesting and different from any page I’ve seen before so the creator did a really good job at engaging my eyes.

  A history of racial injustice stood out to me because it, not only, interacts with the audience, but it gets its point across very well. I’m not usually interested in history unless it deals with African Americans or People of Color, solely because I was only taught lessons about old white men. I grew tired of hearing what these old white men did for our country when my ancestors were really the ones that built the very place we live in now. The very place people like me are intimidated to walk out of the house in fear of being ridiculed or even murdered for the hue of our skin. Going through this website can sometimes anger me, but it also serves as an educational purpose for people out there, all while being very interactive and tech forward. It even has tab for the viewer to help out if they wanted.

  The New York City Map website is impressive in its ability to engage the audience in ways other websites cannot. It’s almost as if I am playing a game when I interact with it. Although it is very outdated, it has some new qualities to it leading me to believe that it was far too ahead of its time. However, websites like these from the Y2K era always intrigue me because I see what it was like back then and how far we’ve come. But aside from seeing how far we’ve come, I also can appreciate the aesthetic of it. It’s quirky. It’s fun. It has the kind of late 90’s to early 2000’s look that I am immensely obsessed with. If this were a review, I’d give it about a six out of ten for the amount of work that was put into it and its fun aspect.
